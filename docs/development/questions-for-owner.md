# Questions for the owner

Questions that came up during autonomous work. None of them blocks the work: each one says what was done meanwhile.
Answer inline (or in the vault's decisions list), and the next session acts on the answer.

## Open

### Q1. Should a second client logged in as the same GM be refused? (2026-10-31)
Foundry lets one user log in from two browsers. With the GM, both clients then act as the WildPath authority
(`game.users.activeGM` names a user, not a client). Every Action is resolved twice, and every request reaches its
Player twice. Seen live on 2026-10-31, when another session's browser stayed logged in as the GM.

- Done meanwhile: a stray duplicate prompt no longer ends the next Action (`6bb6c8c7`). The rule "one GM login per
  world" is in `docs/architecture/multiplayer-authority.md`.
- Options:
  1. Leave it as a documented rule.
  2. Each GM client claims the authority over the socket; a second one warns its user and stands down.
  3. Show a warning only.
- Recommendation: option 3 first (cheap: a notice when another client of the same GM user answers), then 2 if it
  ever happens in play.

### Q2. A Player who reconnects mid-Action: send their prompt again? (2026-10-31)
Plan item 1.1 asked that "a reconnecting client is sent its open prompts again". Today a Player who disconnects has
their open requests handed to the GM at once (`releaseRequestsOf`), so nothing waits on them when they return.
Sending the prompt back would mean taking it away from the GM again.

- Done meanwhile: nothing; the GM answers, or cancels with Cancel Action.
- Recommendation: keep it as it is. Ask again only if Players complain that the GM answers for them after a reload.

### Q3. A GM creature's own rerolls beside the players' monster offer (2026-10-31)
When a GM creature rolls and some player has Heroic Inspiration, the GM is asked "Reroll its roll with a player
character's Heroic Inspiration?" (`inspirationMonsterRerolls`). A test says the creature's own options are then never
offered (`test/transform-action.test.mjs`: Indomitable "never on a monster's GM-chosen reroll"), so a GM-run fighter
loses its Indomitable, and a GM creature its own Countercharm or a Bardic Inspiration die, whenever a player holds a point.

- Done meanwhile: an ally's help (another creature's Countercharm) now joins after a failure, asked of the ally's
  player (see `docs/architecture/reactions.md`, Countercharm). The creature's own options still follow the test.
- Question: was "never on a monster's reroll" meant to keep the GM's dialog about the players' points only, or should a
  GM creature's own features join it after a failure, like an ally's do now?
- Recommendation: let them join after a failure (`failedOnly`), which is one line per helper.
