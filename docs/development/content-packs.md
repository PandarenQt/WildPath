# Built-in Content Packs

WildPath ships its own compendium packs. The first is **WildPath Actions** (`wildpath.actions`, Items), in
Foundry's Compendium Packs sidebar tab.

## Workflow

- **Sources.** Each pack is a folder of JSON Document sources in `packs/_source/<pack>/`, one file per
  Document. Every source carries `_key: "!items!<_id>"` and a stable 16-character `_id`.
- **Build.** `npm run build:packs` compiles every source folder into the LevelDB pack Foundry reads at
  `packs/<pack>/`, using `@foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli` 3.0.4, pinned exactly (approved by the maintainer on
  2026-10-14).
- **Versioning.** Only the sources are in git. Compiled packs are build output (`.gitignore`).
- **Manifest.** `system.json` declares each pack. Its label is a `lang/en.json` key, which Foundry
  localizes.
- **Close the world before rebuilding.** A running world holds a lock on every pack it loaded. A new pack
  appears only after the world is launched again.

## Checks

- **Node** (`test/content-packs.test.mjs`):
  - every source folder is declared in `system.json`;
  - every entry is a valid Action Item (the ActionDefinition validator, a unique `_id` and definition id,
    and the `_key` format);
  - the CLI compiles the sources and reads them back unchanged.
- **Quench** (`wildpath.documents`): the loaded pack's Actions import onto an Actor with valid definitions.
  The case skips until the world has been launched with the pack.

Live (14.369, after the maintainer relaunched the world):
- Both clients list the localized "WildPath Actions" with its nine entries.
- The Quench import case passed.
- Player1 imported Melee Strike from the pack and hit with it through `Item.use()`.

## WildPath Actions

Mechanical data only, with no descriptions (AGENTS §22). Item names are functional labels, for the
maintainer to review.

| Action | Mechanic it represents |
| --- | --- |
| Melee Strike | melee weapon attack, 1d8 slashing |
| Ranged Shot | ranged attack with normal and long range (80/320 ft), 1d6 piercing |
| Quick Jab | a Bonus Action attack, 1d4 bludgeoning |
| Trip | a hit applies Prone |
| Venom Burst | Fortitude save DC 13: 2d6 poison, half on a success, Poisoned on a failure |
| Mending Touch | healing, 1d8 |
| Scaling Bolt | 2d6 fire, cast with a level 1 or 2 slot, +1d6 per level above 1 |
| Burning Ground | 10-ft lasting area: 2 fire on casting, then 4 fire on entering or starting a turn there |
| Guardian Aura | 5-ft concentration aura: 3 radiant to creatures it enters or that start a turn in it |

Each mechanic was first proven live in the representative gate (M1–M3).
